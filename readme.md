# crawlerino - simple Python 3 web crawler
Crawlerino is a web crawler written in Python 3, and is intended to be used as a starting point for building customized web crawlers to perform various tasks. It uses the _requests_ and _Beautiful Soup_ modules, and the code is optimized for readability and flexibility, not for performance.

The emphasis here is on simplicity, and tothat end here are some things that crawlerino does _not_ handle:

* It doesn't handle authentication, although the use of requests makes this easy to add if needed.
* It doesn't spoof headers. Again, easy to add via requests if desired.
* It ignores robots.txt.

## Installation
/// pip install the modules, that's it

## Example
/// show the test case
